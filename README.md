Getting that hopefully useful knowledge
Heyo little dingus. 
I drink loose leaf tea, pump my arms a bit too much on ellipticals, and am trying my best to stay afloat in a new role at work.
I have a purple monkey named Snugs and wish I could wear leggings as pants (and by wish, I mean I do on the reg). 
I'm the starburstowl.
